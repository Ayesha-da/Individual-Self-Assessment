# Individual-Self-Assessment

## Self-assessment
### Why this project
I started searching  for the idea that we can make a project about 3 months ago . I wanted to do something that is related to the medical field. I searched various datasets and came across chest x_ray dataset that had both normal and pneumonia categories.This dataset was quite interesting for me and I wanted to make a model that process images.
Next was to see if my team agrees with it, I presented them this idea along with other ideas like heart failure prediction etc. My team liked pneumonia prediction idea and we went with it.
### My Role
I took the responsibilty of training the machine learning model because I find machine learning very interesting and I enjoyed testing various models and techniques. I decided to choose cnn model because they are  used for image classification and recognition and gives high accuracy.
I had to face difficulties along the way such as severe overfitting problem that is common for CNN models. I tried various techniques such as various hyperparameters various activation functions and adding dropout layers, normalization functions, increasing/decreasing nodes ,to work with the model.These techniques didn't help then I started researching about the topic and realized that in order to make the model perform well i made it too complex by adding number of layers, number of dropout and normalization functions.
So I went back took out all the layers and started with a simple basic CNN model and started adding layers until I see better accuracy and reasonable size of saved model file.
There are over 5800 images and there were difficulties reading and training and testing the images on the model. So I found google colab GPU runtime that works better than any other configuration.
