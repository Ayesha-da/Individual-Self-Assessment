# Individual-Self-Assessment

## Self-assessment
### Why this project
I started searching  for the idea that we can make a project about 3 months ago . I wanted to do something that is related to the medical field. I searched various datasets and came across chest x_ray dataset that had both normal and pneumonia categories.This dataset was quite interesting for me and I wanted to make a model that process images.
Next was to see if my team agrees with it, I presented them this idea along with other ideas like heart failure prediction etc. My team liked pneumonia prediction idea and we went with it.
### My Role
I took the responsibilty of training the machine learning model because I find machine learning, very interesting and I enjoyed testing various model and techniques.
